1) Unsigned/invalid-signed or non-Microsoft kernel drivers loaded

DeviceImageLoadEvents
| where FileName endswith ".sys"
| where not(FolderPath has @"\Windows\System32\drivers\") or true
| where SignatureStatus != "Valid" or isempty(Signer) or Signer !contains "Microsoft"
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, SHA1, Signer, SignatureStatus, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by TimeGenerated desc

2) Drivers loaded from suspicious (user-writable) paths

DeviceImageLoadEvents
| where FileName endswith ".sys"
| where FolderPath has_any (":\\Users\\", ":\\ProgramData\\", ":\\Windows\\Temp\\", ":\\PerfLogs\\", ":\\$Recycle.Bin\\")
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, SHA1, Signer, SignatureStatus, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by TimeGenerated desc

3) New service/driver installs (common for malicious driver drops)

Use one of these depending on your data source.

DeviceEvents
| where ActionType in ("ServiceInstalled","DriverInstallation")
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, AccountName, AdditionalFields, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by TimeGenerated desc


Sentinel (SecurityEvent 7045):

SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 7045
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, SubjectUserName, ServiceName, ServiceFileName, ServiceType
| order by TimeGenerated desc

4) “Drop-then-load” correlation (write to drivers dir → load within 15 min)

let Drops = DeviceFileEvents
  | where FileName endswith ".sys" and FolderPath has @"\Windows\System32\drivers\"
  | project DeviceName, SHA1, DropTime=TimeGenerated, DroppedBy=InitiatingProcessFileName, DropCmd=InitiatingProcessCommandLine, FileName, FolderPath;
DeviceImageLoadEvents
| where FileName endswith ".sys"
| project DeviceName, SHA1, LoadTime=TimeGenerated, Loader=InitiatingProcessFileName, LoadCmd=InitiatingProcessCommandLine, FileName
| join kind=innerunique (Drops) on DeviceName, SHA1
| where LoadTime between (DropTime .. DropTime + 15m)
| order by LoadTime desc

Tip: Pair these with the Microsoft Recommended Driver Blocklist (WDAC) and HVCI; alert when any of the above coincides with outbound beaconing from the same host within ±10 min.

Need to know memory foresnsics

dll loading and AMSI are traditional EDR detections
dll hooking

Malware is memory-only to bypass edr 

key logging efiltration running remote shell

real payloads are in memory

system call monitoring are undetectable
all normal apps ask system for permission to do things, does a system call (ring-0)
ntdll.dll is last user module before kernel
EDR's live in Userland and are always caught everything under ntdll.dll

make system calls outside of where EDR looks
nt is in userland (system call)
zw is in memory (system call)

each system call has rtheir own numbers

BYPASSES:

1. Module unhooking api unhooking
2. malware will unhook handlers

ntdll.dll is the first system call in memeory first dll that's loaded, has all system calls, where EDR lives. 

overwrite all system hooks edr hooks. 

SILENT STRIKE TESTS EDR BYPASSES

Mtprotectvirtual memory is hooked, which is the mail PAI mailware uses to execute code injection and keeps styealthy

EDR says red/write/execute on Ntprocessmemory stops a lot of malware from propagating and bypassing detection API hooking

process hollowing is writing a legtimiate process to memory and then replacing it with malicious code instead, the they  ResumeThread function, a standard Windows API call for the payload to run. 
The application and ntdll will run at this stage

# Kerberos Attack Hunter Suite  
**Author:** Ala Dabat  
**Version:** 2025-12  
**Collection:** Advanced Threat Hunting — Kerberos Abuse Detection (MDE + Sentinel)

---

## Overview

Kerberos authentication abuse remains one of the most reliable paths to domain compromise.  
This suite provides **behavioural, intent-based, and identity-aware** detections across:

- Golden Ticket Forging  
- Silver Ticket Forging  
- Pass-the-Hash (Overpass-the-Hash)  
- Pass-the-Ticket  
- Kerberoasting SPN Sprays  
- Privileged Account Kerberos Anomalies  
- Offensive Tooling Behaviour (Mimikatz, Rubeus, Kekeo, Impacket)

These rules form a unified **Kerberos Attack Cluster**, correlating endpoint and identity telemetry into a single high-fidelity analytic that reduces noise and increases detection confidence.

## Stress Testing Methodology (Noise vs Fidelity)

1. Endpoint Rule (Tooling)

Disable the risk threshold temporarily:

// Remove: | where RiskScore >= 50

Then run across 7 days:

Group by filename, principal, and command line patterns

Identify legitimate admin scripts with /dump, /export, or “ticket”

Add them to an allowlist or refine regex exclusions

2. Kerberoasting (SPN Storm)

Check which accounts request >15 SPNs normally

Add known vuln scanners or monitoring agents to ScannerAccounts

Raise threshold in high-SPN environments (SQL-heavy domains)

3. Identity Anomaly (New Host)

Review accounts using multiple workstations legitimately

Lower or raise NewHostMinEvents depending on logon frequency

4. Cluster Rule

Verify combinations of Endpoint + Identity signals

Ensure privileged accounts are correctly tagged

Tune correlation window if hosts generate bursts of events

Deployment Recommendations

Run each rule separately in Hunting first
Validate noise, assess false positives, refine thresholds.

Deploy the Cluster rule as a scheduled analytic
This should fire only for high-confidence, multi-signal attacks.

Tag Privileged Accounts
Add all admin, service, and Tier-0 accounts to PrivilegedAccounts.

Tune Scanner Accounts
Add Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7, internal vuln scan service accounts.

Example IOC Patterns (Not exhaustive)

Forging / Golden Ticket:
```

kerberos::golden /rc4:<32hex>

/aes256:<64hex>

/groups:512

/sid:S-1-5-21-…

Pass-the-Hash:

-hashes :<NTLM hash>

sekurlsa::pth /user:...

Pass-the-Ticket:

/ptt

ticket::import

.kirbi / .ccache

```

Kerberoasting:

Repeated 4769 TGS requests

RC4 (0x17) usage across many SPNs

Final Notes

This suite is intentionally behaviour-first.
It detects:

Attacker intent

Credential material misuse

Identity drift

SPN spray patterns

Ticket forging/dumping activity

It does not rely on binary names, hashes, or signatures.
It works even when tools are renamed, obfuscated, or memory-loaded.
